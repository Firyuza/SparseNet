# SparseNet

Not finished code was developed based on https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/app/S21-13.pdf paper.

Complex approach that requires retrain network after each sparse procedure, but still interesting for investigating strong connections between neurons.
Keeping only needed neurons connections can localize face more accurate.

Welcome for discussing or intending to finish this work!
